# 🛠️ Customer Support Optimization Demo – DoubleService (Anonymized)

This demo showcases anonymized tools and processes I implemented during my internship at DoubleService to improve customer support, bug tracking, and regression testing for a government SaaS platform.

## 🔧 Tools Simulated
- `SQL Profiler`: Simulated query logs & SOP
- `Notion`: Issue tracking SOP + sample ticket format
- `Playwright`: Basic automated test cases
- `Postman`: Pre-check API collection & usage guide

> 📌 This repo is intended as a *showcase only* – no production data is included.

## 🧠 Demo Use Case

Imagine a support team dealing with unexpected bugs after version upgrades on a shared multi-tenant government system. These tools helped:
- Standardize ticket creation
- Speed up bug replication for engineers
- Run tests before every deployment
- Validate 3rd-party APIs before escalation
